# Synups Networking
Synups Networking is an open-source peer-to-peer networking framework designed specifically for Unity. This robust framework was meticulously developed as part of a bachelor thesis at Halmstad University by Jakob Forsbacka and Gustav Sollenius. It has been rigorously tested to support up to 64 concurrent players per lobby, with each player contributing 12 packets/s and 0.7 kB/s to all other clients, demonstrating its capability to handle high-traffic multiplayer environments.

# Features
* **Automatic Lobby System:** Simplifies the process of creating and joining game sessions, allowing players to easily connect with each other.
* **Remote Procedural Call (RPC):** Enables the execution of methods across the network, facilitating real-time interaction between players.
* **Synchronization Variable (SyncVar):** Ensures consistent game states across all clients by synchronizing variables.
* **Built-in NAT Transversal and Relay Server:** Facilitates connections between players behind NATs, enhancing the framework's accessibility and usability.
* **Automatic Position Synchronization:** Ensures smooth and accurate movement of game objects across all clients.
* **Interest Management:** Optimizes network resources by only updating clients about game objects within their area of interest.
* **Reliable and Unreliable Communication Channels:** Provides options for different types of data transmission based on the requirements of the game.
* **Built-in In-Game Chat:** Allows players to communicate with each other directly within the game.
* **Network Statistics:** Provides valuable insights into the network's performance, aiding in optimization and troubleshooting.
* **Consistency Control:** Ensures a consistent and fair gaming experience by managing and synchronizing game states across all clients.
